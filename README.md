# Yield Curve Curvature Mean-Reverting Trading Strategy

This project introduces a trading strategy based on the mean-reversion of the yield curve's curvature, utilizing U.S. Treasuries yield curve rates from August 2001 to July 2022. The yield curve, a vital indicator of economic conditions, typically slopes upward, but deviations from historical norms are exploited. The strategy involves a Barbell Strategy, investing in two ends of the yield curve while shorting the middle, and employs three methods to calculate the unconditional yield curve. The trading process considers confidence scores, adjusting trades accordingly. 

While the strategy generates steady returns, especially focusing on short-term bonds, caution is advised due to limitations and the impact of market conditions, as seen during the Covid pandemic.
